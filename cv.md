### About myself  
Last year I discovered the field of front-end development. I attend many online courses and webinars. I have been studying this profession at the Netology school  for about six months and at the same time I am improving my qualifications at the RSSchool.  
Frontend is perhaps the most interesting direction, it allows you to develop programming and design skills. With great pleasure I devote all my free time to this.  

## Key skills  
- **Programming skills:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, MySQL, SQL  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code  
- **VCS:** Git, GitHub  

## Code examples  
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) task «Power of two»: write a function that determines whether a given non-negative integer is a power of two.  

```js script
let isPowerOfTwo = (n) => n === 0 ? false : n === 1 ? true : n%2 !== 0 ? false : n === 2**Math.log2(n) ? true : false
```
